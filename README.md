# asterboids
3D html5 cuboid asteroids demonstration with experimental webcam motion tracking.

Try at http://steve58.github.io/asterboids

Includes the plain javascript 3D engine from github.com/Steve58/asterboids project.

Control via webcam with a headtorch and/or torch, or view/perspective mode only using edge detection to track your head/body position via webcam (see menu page). Chrome or Firefox recommended.

This is an experiment, using a webcam to try tracking (a) the user's head position, to give a 3D point-of-view effect, and (b) a secondary reference to control movement of a ship in the game.
